# Dependencies
LIMP is Python based. It's tested in small number of environments running Python 3.5+.
Since LIMP is originally built for Masaar use-cases, it's based on `MongoDB` the database engine of choice by Masaar, as well as it requires `Twilio` SDK to be installed even if you are not planning to use their platform.

The current list of requirements is: https://github.com/masaar/limp/requirements.txt.

LIMP provides easy to use CLI interface that also gives the developers the ability to install the dependencies of LIMP and the packages.
